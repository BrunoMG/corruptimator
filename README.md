## Summary:

Corruptimator&trade; is a bunch of Bash shell scripts loosely cobbled together in an attempt

## Requirements:

### OS 

This has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and no guarantees whatsoever are given that it will run at all anywhere else. However it should work on any POSIX-compliant operating system including Linux.

The following software is also needed:

* ffmpeg ([Mac OS X installation guide](http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/ffmpeg-howto.html))

## Usage 

### Setup
1. Choose a place somewhere on your hard drive to locate the working folder. e.g. /tmp/CORRUPTIMATOR
2. Copy the corrupted images from the web/FTP server into
   /tmp/CORRUPTIMATOR/01_all_corrupted
3. Update the shell scripts to point to the correct path locations as above
4. Copy timer3.sh to ~/bin/timer3 and change its permissions to allow execution (chmod u+x ~/bin/timer3)
5. Open a Terminal window and execute the following commands in order:

### Process 
1. Clean up filenames
Removes any illegal characters from the filenames
<pre><code>clean-image-filenames.sh</code></pre>

2. Generate timestamps
Generates symbolic links to the cleaned-up filenames, named according to image creation date  
<pre><code>sort-images.sh</code></pre>

3. Resize images
Resize images to the desired output video frame size (currently hard-coded to 1024x576)
<pre><code>resize-images.sh</code></pre>

4. Sequence images
Create a consecutively numbered image sequence
<pre><code>sequence-images.sh</code></pre>

5. Generate video 
This is currently hard-coded to generate 24fps video in an MP4 container at 1800kbps 
<pre><code>make-video.sh</code></pre>
