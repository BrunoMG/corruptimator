## Changelog:

### v0.1 : February 25th, 2011 - Initial release

## License:

* Everything else: [The Unlicense](http://unlicense.org) (aka: public domain)

## Summary:

Corruptimator&trade; is a bunch of Bash shell scripts loosely cobbled together in an attempt
to simplify and automate the process of assembling a movie from five years' worth
of images generated by [CORRUPT&trade;](http://corrupt.recyclism.com).

## Warning:

Please be careful with this software. If you don't know what you're doing, you can
easily make a big mess or lose important data. Your use of this software is
entirely at your own risk, and you are solely responsible for any damages that
may be incurred. You have been warned!

## Requirements:

### OS 

This has only been tested on Mac OS X 10.6 and no guarantees whatsoever are given that it will run at all anywhere else. However it should work on any POSIX-compliant operating system including Linux.

The following software is also needed:

* ffmpeg ([Mac OS X installation guide](http://stephenjungels.com/jungels.net/articles/ffmpeg-howto.html))

## Usage 

### Setup
1. Choose a place somewhere on your hard drive to locate the working folder. e.g. /tmp/CORRUPTIMATOR
2. Update the $base_dir value in the five Bash scripts to point to the correct path as chosen in step 1
3. Copy the corrupted images from the web/FTP server into
   /tmp/CORRUPTIMATOR/01_all_corrupted
4. Copy timer3.sh to somewhere in your path (e.g. ~/bin/timer3) and change its permissions to allow execution (chmod u+x ~/bin/timer3). 
5. Open a Terminal window and execute the following commands in order:

### Process 
1. Clean up filenames  
> <pre><code>clean-image-filenames.sh</code></pre>  
> Removes any illegal characters from the filenames  
2. Generate timestamps  
> <pre><code>sort-images.sh</code></pre>  
> Generates symbolic links to the cleaned-up filenames, named according to image creation date  
3. Resize images  
> <pre><code>resize-images.sh</code></pre>  
> Resize images to the desired output video frame size (currently hard-coded to 1024x576)  
4. Sequence images  
> <pre><code>sequence-images.sh</code></pre>  
> Create a consecutively numbered image sequence  
5. Generate video  
> <pre><code>make-video.sh</code></pre>  
> This is currently hard-coded to generate 24fps video in an MP4 container at 1800kbps.
